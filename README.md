### Introduction
Littlebytes is one stop mobile application designed to support new parents in caring for their baby. Littlebytes' goal is to alleviate the stress from parenting and provide personalised guidance on how to care for their baby.

### Functions
Littlebytes allows users to input and keep track of important data about their child such as their body metrics, eating habits, sleep schedules and other daily habits. It provides personalised insights on the baby's development such as meal and healthcare recommendations. Trends regarding your baby's body metrics, sleeping patterns and more are displayed in the Statistics page.

Click the "Run and Debug" button and the app will run on the simulator, opening to the onboarding screen. After all required details are entered, you will be redirected to the home page, where all the other pages and functions can be viewed.
